# CuteFishOS-Unofficial
This repository is a personal secondary development project for the cutefish project since the cutefish project was stopped.
The original project maintainer no longer maintains this project. Out of my personal love for the system, I decided to re maintain the project.
Cutefishos is a distribution based on Debian, Ubuntu and archlinux. I have to admit that the CuteFish DE desktop environment is great.
Of course, you can also download the source code package in this repository and build it manually to install CuteFish DE into your system.
Most software packages can be easily built into your system with Cmake tool. You can rest assured that we are very friendly to novices.
